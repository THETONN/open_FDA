# openFDA_drug_event_parsing

https://open.fda.gov/

As part of my own thesis work and the data used in the March 2020 precisionFDA challenge, this repository contains the code used to download, extract, and process the human drug event data found here https://open.fda.gov/downloads/.

The notebooks were created for prototyping, then converted to scripts for running the methodology in parallel on a multicore machine. 

The processed data was the converted into a set of tables with entity relationships.
